Rust library for using the [Serde] serialization framework with data in [YAML]
file format.

This library is a fork from the latest commit of [serde-yaml](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml),
which was `200950`.
<sup>\[[original](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml/commit/2009506d33767dfc88e979d6bc0d53d09f941c94)\]</sup>

My goal is to be compatible as much as possible with [David Tolnay](https://github.com/dtolnay)'s original library.

[YAML]: https://yaml.org/

## Dependency

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
serde_yaml_ng = "0.9"
```

Release notes are available under [GitHub releases].

## Using Serde YAML

[API documentation is available in rustdoc form][docs.rs] but the general idea
is:

[docs.rs]: https://docs.rs/serde_yaml_ng

```rust
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

fn main() -> Result<(), serde_yaml_ng::Error> {
    // You have some type.
    let mut map = BTreeMap::new();
    map.insert("x".to_string(), 1.0);
    map.insert("y".to_string(), 2.0);

    // Serialize it to a YAML string.
    let yaml = serde_yaml_ng::to_string(&map)?;
    assert_eq!(yaml, "x: 1.0\ny: 2.0\n");

    // Deserialize it back to a Rust type.
    let deserialized_map: BTreeMap<String, f64> = serde_yaml_ng::from_str(&yaml)?;
    assert_eq!(map, deserialized_map);
    Ok(())
}
```

It can also be used with Serde's derive macros to handle structs and enums
defined in your program.

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_yaml_ng = "0.9"
```

Structs serialize in the obvious way:

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn main() -> Result<(), serde_yaml_ng::Error> {
    let point = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };

    let yaml = serde_yaml_ng::to_string(&point)?;
    assert_eq!(yaml, "x: 1.0\ny: 2.0\n");

    let deserialized_point: Point = serde_yaml_ng::from_str(&yaml)?;
    assert_eq!(point, deserialized_point);
    Ok(())
}
```

Enums serialize using YAML's `!tag` syntax to identify the variant name.

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, PartialEq, Debug)]
enum Enum {
    Unit,
    Newtype(usize),
    Tuple(usize, usize, usize),
    Struct { x: f64, y: f64 },
}

fn main() -> Result<(), serde_yaml_ng::Error> {
    let yaml = "
        - !Newtype 1
        - !Tuple [0, 0, 0]
        - !Struct {x: 1.0, y: 2.0}
    ";
    let values: Vec<Enum> = serde_yaml_ng::from_str(yaml).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(values[0], Enum::Newtype(1));
    assert_eq!(values[1], Enum::Tuple(0, 0, 0));
    assert_eq!(values[2], Enum::Struct { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 });

    // The last two in YAML's block style instead:
    let yaml = "
        - !Tuple
          - 0
          - 0
          - 0
        - !Struct
          x: 1.0
          y: 2.0
    ";
    let values: Vec<Enum> = serde_yaml_ng::from_str(yaml).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(values[0], Enum::Tuple(0, 0, 0));
    assert_eq!(values[1], Enum::Struct { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 });

    // Variants with no data can be written using !Tag or just the string name.
    let yaml = "
        - Unit  # serialization produces this one
        - !Unit
    ";
    let values: Vec<Enum> = serde_yaml_ng::from_str(yaml).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(values[0], Enum::Unit);
    assert_eq!(values[1], Enum::Unit);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Why?

I haven't found any good fork as of the start of this project. The best candidate was
[serde\_yml](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/serde_yml) which is based on
[a giant "Initial commit" from the main maintainer](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/serde_yml/commit/4312d4a56225b223410b5133af571fd13e62f18a).
This is the type of practices which leads to [security disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor).

I don't want to fight with people about their practices, that's why I'm
maintaining this library for myself, and for the rust ecosystem as a whole.
As we say in French: "*You are never better served than by yourself*". ðŸ˜‰

Use it, don't use it, I don't care. I'll try to fix as many bugs as I can.
I'll accept pull requests if they're reasonable or easy to work with.

## Financial Support

I'm a guy working out of his garage at night with a well-paid job during the day. I
do not need your money. **Please! Instead, give money to
[David Tolnay](https://github.com/dtolnay).** This guy
[carries half of the Rust ecosystem on his shoulders](https://crates.io/users/dtolnay),
and wrote most of the code for this project before I forked it. I'm just a
loser who jumped on the train, don't give me any money.
